# Player League Management
PLM is an MVC application to manage a soccer league. Currently, I'm working on this project but so far we have things like auditing, CRUD operations, among others. Therefore, if you clone this project you will have something to play. The models at the moment are:

## Additional notes
Because I'm still working on the final prototype to get a fully functional application, for a while there will not be a guide on how to contribute, but once I finish I'll do it, thank you for your understanding.
